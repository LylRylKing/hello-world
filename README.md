just another repository

Hi! I'm Alex and I'm mostly new to coding. I did some in school and I didn't really like it. When I got older, I got more intereasted in it so I decided to act upon it! I'm learning HTML, C, and Java Script to get a hand on the basics. I use Sololearn to learn these languages.
